{#
Page to show when returned from PSP

- Url is "/payment/<payment-nr>"
- Uses controller_template
- Check status of payment, show 'paid', 'error', or 'pending' page.
- Those statuses are blocks, so easy to overrule.

(Note that any connected actions are already performed, as a result of payment_status notifications)

TODO: we need a continuation url, optionally specify this when starting the payment
